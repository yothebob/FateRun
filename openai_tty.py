# quickstart docs, I THINK I might integrate openai with the option to use my default or openai one

# from pathlib import Path
# from openai import OpenAI
# client = OpenAI()

# speech_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "speech.mp3"
# response = client.audio.speech.create(
#   model="tts-1",
#   voice="alloy",
#   input="Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!"
# )

# response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)
